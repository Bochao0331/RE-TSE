# RE-TSE
Matlab scripts to run image reconstruction as described in the manuscript "Distortion correction in TSE near metal implants at 0.55T using a model-based reconstruction with a reversed frequency-encoding approach."
Before run the codes in this repository, you need to install the following dependencies:

- BART: [Installation Instructions](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/webinars.html)
- FINUFFT: [Installation Instructions](https://finufft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matlab.html)
- ISMRMD: [Installation Instructions](https://ismrmrd.github.io/apidocs/1.5.0/)

Use the batch_dual_pec_recon. the batch process for Type-1 NUFFT incorporating gradient nonlinearity and off-resonance displacement map-based phase-constrained CG-SENSE reconstruction
